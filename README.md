## Learning Outcome

By completing Repo 1, you will practice and understand:

    - git clone – copy repo to your local system

    - git add – stage changes

    - git status – check repo status

    - git commit – save changes locally

    - git push – send changes to GitHub

    - git pull – get latest updates from GitHub

    - git fetch – check remote updates

This will set the foundation for collaborative work in later repositories.
