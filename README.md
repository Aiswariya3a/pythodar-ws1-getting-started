#  Git & GitHub Workshop – Repo 1

Welcome to **Repo 1** of the Git & GitHub Workshop series.  
This repository is designed to help students and faculty learn the basics of Git and GitHub through hands-on practice.  

---

##  Purpose of This Repository  

The purpose of **Workshop | Repo 1** is to:  
- Introduce students and faculty to **Git basics** (clone, add, commit, push, pull).  
- Practice **collaboration skills** by organizing bio-data files inside structured folders.  
- Build confidence in working with GitHub before moving on to advanced repositories.  
- Provide a **starter repo** that acts as a sandbox for experimentation and learning.  

## Folder Structure

-  The repository is organized as follows. You can copy-paste this structure directly:

Repo-1/
├── Students/
│   └── SampleStudent.md
├── Faculty/
│   └── SampleFaculty.md
└── README.md




## General Instructions for Students  

1. Go to the `Students/` folder.  
2. Create a new Markdown file with your **Roll Number** as the filename. Example: `22EI012.md`.  
3. Inside your file, add your **bio data** in the following format:  

   ```markdown
   # Student Bio Data

   **Name:** Your Full Name

4. Stage and commit your file changes using:
   
    1. ```git add```
   
    2. ```2it commit -m "Added my biodata file (RollNo)``

    3. ```git push```

2. Create a new Markdown file with your Employee ID as the filename. Example: 904641.md.

3. Add your bio data in a simple Markdown format (similar to students).


## Learning Outcome

By completing Repo 1, you will practice and understand:

    - git clone – copy repo to your local system

    - git add – stage changes

    - git status – check repo status

    - git commit – save changes locally

    - git push – send changes to GitHub

    - git pull – get latest updates from GitHub

    - git fetch – check remote updates

This will set the foundation for collaborative work in later repositories.
